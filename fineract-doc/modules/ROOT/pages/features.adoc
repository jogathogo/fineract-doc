== Headless architecture

Fineract is a groundbreaking open-source platform that reimagines financial software architecture through a "headless" design. This approach separates the frontend user interface from the backend logic, resulting in remarkable adaptability.

At its core, Fineract's headless architecture offers a distinctive advantage by enabling diverse frontends to interact seamlessly with a consistent backend. This flexibility enables tailored user experiences, as different interfaces for web, mobile, and more can be developed independently without affecting core functionalities. Scalability is also enhanced, as resources can be optimized for specific components.

image:organization.png[Organization configuration features]

image:office_structure.png[Office structure]

Customers and users must be tagged to an office. 

User access can be limited to an office with the user having access to the office they have been tagged to and all offices below.

For digital banks, having the head office should suffice.

=== Currency
Use this feature to add currenc(ies). All products and fees require a currency to be tagged as the operating currency. Please note, each product/charge only supports one currency.

The platform does not support forex operations. Currency conversions have to be handled externally.

=== Employees 
Empployees are optionally tagged to customers, loans, savings and deposit accounts . They are also tagged(mandantory) in the teller module.

=== Payment types
Payment types are used to track the channel through which a payment was made. It can be useful for reconciliation and auditing purposes.

When used with accounting module, the payment type is linked to a GL account and determines the account debited or credited when the payment type is used in a transaction.

=== Working days and Manage Holidays
These two features allow the setting of days on which loan repayment will not be possible because the physical office has been closed. Repayments due on these days are rescheduled to next working day or previous day.

With the availability of online payment channels through which customers can make repayment even when the physical office is closed, these features may not be necessary and are optional. 

=== Standing instructions
The platform allows creation and management of standing instructions. Standing instructions can be from account to account, account to loan, account to deposit accounts.

Loan repayments can be automated using standing instructions where the amount due is collected from the link account.

=== Bulk loan reassignment
Used to assign all the loans from one loan officer to another.

=== Manage funds
This feature allows creation/management of funding partners for organizations with donor funded loan products.

Funds created here appear under funds dropdown when creating loan products and loan accounts as optional fields.

This feature is very useful when generating reports, it allows filtering of loan accounts by fund.

== System administration
image:system-administration.png[System administration]

=== Roles and permissions
image:roles-permissions.png[Roles and permissions]

Fineract supports fine grained permission setup with each activity requiring a permission to execute.

Users are assigned role(s). Permissions are granted to roles.

=== Maker and Checker

=== System users
This feature allows creation and management(change password,edit and delete) of system users.

User passwords can be entered by the system admin manually or auto-generated by the system at account creation and sent to user email address.

[NOTE] 
Its possible to integrate with Identity and Access Management platforms like Keycloak where user account details are stored and managed.

=== Manage codes
Dropdown fields options are managed using this feature. This is especially useful when building a graphical user interface. 

=== Password prefferences
The platform supports two password strength options: simple and complex.

Simple option

Password must be at least 1 character and not more that 50 characters long

Complex password option

Password must be at least 6 characters, no more than 50 characters long, must include at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one numeric digit and no space

=== Web hooks
Every event in the system can be configured to fire a message to another system specified as an end point. This simplifies integration with other systems via sharing of messages. For example, a loan approval event sends a message to the loan origination system which then marks the loan as approved on that system and initiates the disbursment process.
image:web-hooks.png[Web hooks]

=== Audit trail
Every event that results in the creation,update or deletion of a record is tracked and added to the audit trail.

image:audit-trail.png[Audit trail]

The audit trail is searchable by user, date, event among other filters.

=== Scheduler jobs
The platform supports scheduling of tasks as cron jobs. Most of the common jobs such as interest posting, executing standing instructions, sending emails and so on are available out of the box. 

New jobs can be added based on the laid framework.

=== Global configurations
System-wide configurations are set using this feature and determine system behavior. For example, the maker and checker process is disabled by default. To enable this, the configuration is set to true.

There are a total of 51 configurations available out of the box. These cover most of the common scenarios. New configurations can be added with the help of a fineract specialist.

=== External services
This features is used to store configurations necessary to integrate with Amazon S3, Email server, SMS bridge and Notification service.

[NOTE]
These configurations are best stored in the system configurations and not in the database for security reasons. It is available for backwrd compatibility with customers still running older versions of the platform.

=== Two factor authentication
The platform supports 2FA out of the box. This feature is disabled by default and requires some technical knowhow to enable and use.

=== Manage reports
On this module existing reports are managed and new reports added. There are two types of reports supported: table and pentaho reports.

Table reports are created using this feature. Pentaho reports on the other hand are developed using pentaho reports designer and uploaded to the fineract server. Once uploaded, this feature is used to enable/disable the reports.

=== Data tables
This is one of the most powerful features in the system. It allows creation of additional fields and attach them to client,products and office entities without the need of a developer.

This means, by API or on the Mifos UI, you can create new data collection forms and link them to clients, accounts and so on allowing you to collect and manage data. Without this, development effort would be required.

=== Bulk import
Fineract supports bulk data import using excel templates. The user downloads the templates, fills in the data and uploads the file. Once processed, the system will show the status of each record giving details of failed imports which can be reuploaded upon correction of the issue raised.

This allows import of data using excel templates especially when migrating from another system or doing batch upload of data.

The following data can be imported using this feature: see image below

image:bulk-import.png[Bulk Import]
